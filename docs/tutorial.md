Coming soon (would be good to do this in a jupyter notebook).

## Setup
- Installation, Julia environments, changing HallThruster.jl versions

## Using the models
- Built-in cathode, thruster, plume models

## Linking models
- First do a "manual" passing of info between models
- Then show an amisc config.yml file (more info in amisc docs)

## Loading data
- Show how to access experimental data

## Advanced features
- Surrogate and UQ analysis (see how-to guides for details, just give a taste here)
- Model calibration
